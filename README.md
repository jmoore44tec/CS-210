Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
-The purpose of this project was to practice crafting an interactive menu for users to interact with, while also implementing math functions for compounding interest to mimic an investment program. The problem being solved here being abstraction.
The user does not need to be bonmbarded with information or stressful calculations. This program allows for a quick and easy investment planning experience!

What did you do particularly well?
-My formatting and workflow is reflected in my pseudocode as well as the efficiency of the code itself. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
-Unfortunately I did not implement valid input verification allowing for the code to be crashed upon entry of invalid inputs. Setting up countermeasures such as catches would have helped prevent this case making my code much more stable and reliable. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
-The most challenging part of this project was simply crafting the function to properly calculate investments and percentages. To accomplish this I referenced the projects additional requirements files which included some specific information on the 
actual investment calculations. Although I did not require it this time around, an additional resource I use is the help of my good friend who is currently a software engineer. He helped get me on this career path and continues to support me however he can.
Collaboration is important in any line of work, but even more so in fields as challenging and intensive as technology.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
-The ability to create user interactive menus that return information is basic while also very important. This back and forth experience is as common as it can get with technology, and being able to implement various automatic responses based on said user input is important. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
-I organized the code by keeping all functions outside of the main area, enhancing readability by clearly defining different functionalities, hiding important calculations in private in order to prevent accidental tampering, and adding easy to read comments throughout
so that anyone could look at it and easily understand the code.
